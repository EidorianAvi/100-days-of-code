# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 6 2021, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed 50% of the applied visual design course on fcc. 

**Thoughts** I had a really really difficult time focusing today due to the capitol being stormed by Trump supporters. Lots of anxiety today. I would have liked to have worked on my personal project but my focus wasn't there. Tomorrow will hopefully be better.

### Day 2: January 7 2021, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the visual design segmant of fcc today.

**Thoughts** I learned a few tricks in CSS. I will definitely have to refresh on some of the subjects like ::before and ::after pseudo selectors as well as more on the cubic-bezier measurement when it comes to animation time. I am however feeling more confident and understanding in how to build out basic animations using css and @keyframes.
