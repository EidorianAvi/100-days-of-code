# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 6 2021, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed 50% of the applied visual design course on fcc. 

**Thoughts** I had a really really difficult time focusing today due to the capitol being stormed by Trump supporters. Lots of anxiety today. I would have liked to have worked on my personal project but my focus wasn't there. Tomorrow will hopefully be better.

### Day 2: January 7 2021, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the visual design segmant of fcc today.

**Thoughts** I learned a few tricks in CSS. I will definitely have to refresh on some of the subjects like ::before and ::after pseudo selectors as well as more on the cubic-bezier measurement when it comes to animation time. I am however feeling more confident and understanding in how to build out basic animations using css and @keyframes.

### Day 3: January 8 2021, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've been checking out accessibility and covered half of fcc course on it. I also did a code challenge for iterable and passed it. 

**Thoughts** I learned quite a bit about accessability. I always had parts of it but FCC has done really well in breaking it down and why it matters. The code challenge was really difficult to be honest but man I'm glad I passed it.

### Day 4: January 9 2021, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I finished up the web accessibility portion of fcc.

**Thoughts** I think accessibility is super important and I have a much stronger grasp of how to use semantic HTML for screen readers to work properly. I wouldn't say I'm great and it'll take practice to incroporate into things such as React projects but I'd definitely say I understand how to approach it more.

### Day 5: January 10 2021, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I wrote a blog post about accessibility and I finished some hackerrank problems. 

**Thoughts** Was a bit of a light day but I'm happy to have  completed an algorithm and written yet another blog post.

### Day 6: January 11 2021, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced my algorithms today. Was a shorter day but I need it. 

**Thoughts** Getting decent at algorithms. I really do enjoy JavaScript and learn new things about it all the time.

### Day 7: January 12 2021, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the flex segmant of fcc and also finished an algorithm. I spent a good amount of today applying for jobs as well.

**Thoughts**  I'm satisfied with my progress on algorithms but always striving for me. One thing I want to address is a better method for cycling through two arrays than two loops as the time complexity is too high. I enjoy fcc a lot and always learn something new. The job hunt is rough but I have at least heard back from a few companies. Still a work in progress.

### Day 8: January 13 2021, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I finished the flex segmant of fcc and also finished an algorithm. Was a relatively light day.

**Thoughts**  Was a short day today. About to start my work week. Still got some work done.

### Day 9: January 14 2021, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the hackerrank for dropbox and also spent personal time on algorithms. About two hours total today.

**Thoughts**  I've improved on algorithms quite a bit. Hoorah! Not enough though. I could be better. SPecifically working with matrixes and optomizing.
