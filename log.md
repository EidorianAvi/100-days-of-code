# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 6 2021, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed 50% of the applied visual design course on fcc. 

**Thoughts** I had a really really difficult time focusing today due to the capitol being stormed by Trump supporters. Lots of anxiety today. I would have liked to have worked on my personal project but my focus wasn't there. Tomorrow will hopefully be better.
