# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 6 2021, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed 50% of the applied visual design course on fcc. 

**Thoughts** I had a really really difficult time focusing today due to the capitol being stormed by Trump supporters. Lots of anxiety today. I would have liked to have worked on my personal project but my focus wasn't there. Tomorrow will hopefully be better.

### Day 2: January 7 2021, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the visual design segmant of fcc today.

**Thoughts** I learned a few tricks in CSS. I will definitely have to refresh on some of the subjects like ::before and ::after pseudo selectors as well as more on the cubic-bezier measurement when it comes to animation time. I am however feeling more confident and understanding in how to build out basic animations using css and @keyframes.

### Day 3: January 8 2021, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've been checking out accessibility and covered half of fcc course on it. I also did a code challenge for iterable and passed it. 

**Thoughts** I learned quite a bit about accessability. I always had parts of it but FCC has done really well in breaking it down and why it matters. The code challenge was really difficult to be honest but man I'm glad I passed it.
